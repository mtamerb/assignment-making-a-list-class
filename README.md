## **Assignment** 

## Example 1


       We are designing a class in Java where we hold data using the generic construct.
       
       The purpose of the class is to keep a dynamic Array in it and dynamically retrieve the data type. For this, a generic class must be created.
       
       
       
       NOTE : THE COLLECTION CLASS WILL NOT BE USED ! WE MUST CREATE OUR OWN LISTING CLASS.
       
       
       
       Class features:
       
       
       
       The default size of the array in the class is 10 and the number of elements of the array should increase by 2 times as needed.
       
       
       The class must have two types of constructor methods
       
       
       MyList() : If the empty constructor is used, the initial size of the array should be 10.
       
       
       MyList(int capacity) : The initial value of the array should be taken from the capacity parameter.
       
       
       size() : Returns the number of elements in the array.
       
       
       getCapacity() : returns the capacity of the array.
       
       
       add(T data) : It should be used to add an element to the array of the class. If there is not enough space in the array, the array size should be doubled.
